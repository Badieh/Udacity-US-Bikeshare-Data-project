# Udacity-US-Bikeshare-Data-project
⁃I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States :
  • Chicago
  • New York City 
  • Washington
	
⁃I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.

⁃I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
